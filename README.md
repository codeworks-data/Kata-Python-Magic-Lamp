# Kata-Python-Magic-Lamp

This kata is taken from the 2019 BattleDev we've done. It was the 4th/6 exercise, so expect it to be difficult.

## Instructions

You are Aladdin, and just fell into the cave of wonders.

Well, you're quite damn happy about what you see, but the only thing you've got on yourself is your magic lamp.

You magic lamp has a limited capacity of `X` grams. You can see objects (gems, carpets, gold pieces...) of a certain `weight` and a fixed `price` (for 1 object). There's also powders with a certain `quantity` in g and a `price_per_gram`.

You must complete the function `fill(objects, powders)` to go out of the cave with the maximum value you can carry.
You may fill the lamp with as many objects as you like and as many grams of each powder you like.
But be careful, you should never go beyond the maximum capacity of the lamp ! (or so the legend says...) 

## Code

In the `src` folder, you will find `Lamp.py` with the function ready to be implemented.

## Test it

You can test your implementation by running the `src/test/LampTest` class.
